# 🏏 Hand Cricket Game in Python

## 🎮 Overview
Hand Cricket is a fun and interactive game played between a user and a computer. The game follows traditional hand cricket rules, where the player and the computer choose numbers, and if they match, the batsman is out. This project is implemented in Python using basic programming concepts.

## ✨ Features
✅ User-friendly command-line interface  
✅ Randomized computer responses for fair gameplay  
✅ Score tracking system  
✅ Multiple innings support (optional)  
✅ Simple yet engaging gameplay  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python 3
- 🎲 `random` module for computer-generated numbers
- 🔄 Loops and conditional statements for game logic

## 🏆 How to Play
1️⃣ The player chooses a number between 1 and 6.  
2️⃣ The computer randomly selects a number.  
3️⃣ If the numbers match, the batsman is out!  
4️⃣ If not, the chosen number is added to the player's score.  
5️⃣ The game continues until the player gets out.  
6️⃣ The computer then plays its turn, and the player must try to bowl.  
7️⃣ The player with the highest score wins!
